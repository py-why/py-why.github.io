  An introduction to DoWhy, a Python library for causal inference that supports explicit modeling and testing of causal assumptions. 
summary: >-
  Much like machine learning libraries have done for prediction, <strong>“DoWhy” is a Python library that aims to spark causal 
  thinking and analysis.</strong> DoWhy provides a principled four-step interface for causal inference that focuses on 
  explicitly modeling causal assumptions and validating them as much as possible. The key feature of DoWhy is its state-of-the-art 
  refutation API that can automatically test causal assumptions for any estimation method, thus making inference more robust and 
  accessible to non-experts. DoWhy supports estimation of the average causal effect for backdoor, frontdoor, instrumental variable 
  and other identification methods, and estimation of the conditional effect (CATE) through an integration with the EconML library.
