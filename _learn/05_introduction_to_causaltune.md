  An introduction to CausalTune, a Python library for automated tuning and selection of causal estimators. 
summary: >-
  CausalTune is a library for automated tuning and selection for causal estimators.
  <br>
  CausalTune enables automatic estimator tuning and selection by out-of-sample scoring of causal estimators, notably using the energy score.
  We perform automated hyperparameter tuning of first stage models (for the treatment and outcome models) as well as hyperparameter tuning
  and model selection for the second stage model (causal estimator).
  Underlying estimators are taken from EconML, augmented by CausalTune, and called in a uniform fashion via a DoWhy wrapper.
  We use FLAML for hyperparameter optimisation.
